CF Python 401 Linked List assignment
Authors: Joe McClenahan and Wenjing Qiang

Contains methods for creating:
    Linked List
    Stack
    Double Linked List
    Queue
    Deque
    Binary Heap
    Priority Queue
    Directed Graph
        Depth first traversal
        Breadth first traversal
        Dijkstra shortest path search
        Bellman shortest path search

        Dijkstra and Bellman shortest paths are similar but since the Dijkstra algorithm prioritizes searching the child with the smallest weight first, you can cut out some of the steps where we are replacing the child's distance from the search node.  This means the Dijkstra search is faster than the Bellman search.
